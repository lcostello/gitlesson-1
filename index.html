	<p><strong>Article: Learning is one of life’s most important skills. It is defined by the Oxford Dictionary as the acquisition of knowledge or skills through study, experience, or being taught. Learning is something I personally struggled with until I understood that it is a process, a process that needs to be tailored to fit your unique style in order to meet your needs. Hopefully this post will shed light on how you can begin your journey in becoming a great learner.</strong></p>
