	<p><strong>Article: </strong>7 tips on getting your first techy job</p>
	<p> So, you want a techy job but you don’t have a techy degree?
	I have recently landed myself a job as a web developer and no I don’t have a degree in computer science, in fact I’ve recently ended my primary teaching career after 4 years, so I can enter the world of tech. If you’re wanting to take the plunge and change career this article might help you on your way. Here’s how I went from teaching to tech (coding in particular) in 7 (achievable) steps.

	<p><strong>Article: </strong>How effective listening affects communication</p>
	
		<p>“Man’s inability to communicate is a result of his failure to listen effectively” — Carl Rogers.
		Interesting words from Carl Rogers (Psychologist and one of the founders of the Humanistic approach to psychology). Quite often there is a huge emphasis on being able to communicate effectively, but what about listening effectively? And how does listening effectively affect communication?
		The ability to listen may seem like a simple task in itself, but the truth is many people tend to be poor listeners. This is due to an accumulation of bad habits that hinder our ability to listen effectively when we are on the receiving end of communication. Before we explore these habits, we will first identify what effective listening is and how we can improve our ability to listen effectively.</p>
		
		<P>Effective listening is the ability to hear and completely interpret information from its verbal source of communication. To listen effectively 	requires that you pay full attention to the speaker (source) and attempt to completely understand the message. There are three main types of effective listening:		

		<h2>Effective listening: </h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Types of listening</li>
			<li>Active listening</li>
			<li>Reflective listening</li>
			<li>Critical listening</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Active listening encourages the listener to focus their attention completely on the speaker. A common aspect of active listening is attempting to repeat what you have interpreted back to the speaker. This will allow the speaker to confirm your level understanding on the topic. Active listening may also involve gestures and facial expressions and other forms of nonverbal communication to signal your acknowledgement of key points.
		Reflective Listening, similar to active listening, requires the listener to pay full attention to the speaker and use nonverbal cues to provide clarification. However, reflective listening encourages the listener to reflect the speaker’s emotions to show that the speaker is being listened to. To be a good reflective listener, you should empathise with the speaker, control your own emotions during the conversation and look passed the speaker’s behaviour when communicating.</p>

		<p>Critical Listening is often used when trying to evaluate and analyse what the speaker has said and requires the use of personal judgement. This type of listening encourages you to question the logic and credibility of the information being received in order to determine where it will be beneficial.</p>

		<p>“Most people don’t listen with the intent to understand; they listen with the intent to reply” — Stephen Covey
		No matter what type of listening skills you choose to apply, the goal of an effective listener is to fully understand and interpret what is being said. However, as mentioned before, many people are generally poor listeners due to bad habits. There are several bad habits that affect listening but listed below are what I have observed to be the most common hindrances.</p>
		
		<h2>Bad listening habits: </h2>

		<ul>
			<li>Wandering minds </li>
			<li>Assumptions </li>
			<li>Unprepared </li>
			<li>Wandering minds </li>
		</ul>

		When it comes to communication, distraction is probably the most common hindrance to effective listening. Sometimes when we are attempting to listen, our minds tend to wander and get lost in our own thoughts. This normally happens when the conversation is tedious or not very stimulating. This can cause the listener to lose interest in the conversation completely and miss out on vital information. It also doesn’t help if a lot of things are happening in background e.g. noise, movements etc.
		Assumptions
		Sometimes, as listeners, we assume that we know where the speaker is going with the conversation or what they are going to say next. When this happens the listener will often interrupt the speaker or try to finish their sentence. Not only can that be annoying for the speaker, but it can also make them lose their track of thought, thus potentially terminating the conversation too early.
		Unprepared
		Although conversation can happen spontaneously, there are conversations that can and should be prepared for e.g. lectures, meetings, interviews etc. These tend to be where some of the most important information will be transmitted. It pretty much goes without saying to arrive with a pen and notepad to make notes, but what about physical preparation? It is important to clear your mind and relax your body in instances where you will be receiving important information. Why? So that information can be received, fully, accurately and consistently. A clear mind makes room for information and ideas to be absorbed.
		Although there are barriers to listening, there are also useful tips you can use to become a more effective listener and strengthen your ability to communicate effectively. Listed below are some simple yet very effective steps you can take to become a great listener.
		Tips to communicate effectively
		Eye contact
		Visualize
		Open your mind
		Eye contact
		<p>Now before you get the wrong idea, this doesn’t mean you have to be awkward about it. Just simply be attentive and focused by maintaining appropriate eye contact with the speaker and respond with subtle, non verbal expressions e.g. nodding. By maintaining appropriate eye contact you also allow yourself as the listener to remain focused on the speaker and what they are saying which will reduce the chance of distraction. Additionally this will make the speaker feel that you are genuinely interested and they are being taken seriously.</p>
		Visualize
		A great tip when listening is to try and visualise what the speaker is saying. This is especially useful when the speaker is telling a story or is talking for a considerable amount of time. If the speaker is trying to explain something or tell a story, make an attempt to see it from their perspective by forming a picture or mental model of the information they have provided. When visualising, ensure that you pay full attention to what the speaker is saying and maintain your focus so that you can form an accurate interpretation.
		<p>Open your mind
		Last but not least, when listening, open your mind and don’t jump to conclusions. Its tempting to interject when you feel you know what the speaker is about to say, but the truth is, as knowledgable as you may be, you most likely don’t know everything, let alone everything that the speaker is going to talk about. When the urge comes to interrupt, it’s better to contain it and wait for the speaker to finish talking. This way you can guarantee that the speaker would have said what they intended and will not lose track of the conversation.
		Also take your emotions out of it completely. Some of the worst reactions are based on emotions and how the person made you feel; remember, offence is only taken not given, if you disagree with the speaker, use logic and be rational with your response rather than ignorant.
		Although this may seem pretty straight forward, these steps need to be applied and practiced regularly in order for them to become second nature to you as a listener. This will also develop your ability to communicate effectively by expanding your capacity and knowledge, saving time, and intensifying your conversations.

	<p><strong>Article: </strong>Learning is one of life’s most important skills. It is defined by the Oxford Dictionary as the acquisition of knowledge or skills through study, experience, or being taught. Learning is something I personally struggled with until I understood that it is a process, a process that needs to be tailored to fit your unique style in order to meet your needs. Hopefully this post will shed light on how you can begin your journey in becoming a great learner.</p> 
	<p> I thank God for the day my chemistry teacher decided to deliver a lesson on learning styles, it was the day that changed my approach to learning. She ran through the different ways in which people can learn and explained that we are all different. At that time I was failing my A-Levels miserably all because I didn’t know how to learn (slightly also due to the fact that I had little interest in my chosen subjects).</p>
